# Personalization-of-Supermarket-Product-Recommendations

The aim of the project is to extract information in order to suggest to supermarket customers some new products that may be of their interest to buy and are not already on their shopping list.

Input:

• groceries.csv (customers' transactions in the supermarket)

• products-categorized.csv (shows the class and subclass for each product)

Output (created after running the code):

• baskets.csv (unified vectors of subclasses of products in each basket)

• recommendations.csv (top 10 product recommendations for each customer, with porducts that are not included in their basket)
